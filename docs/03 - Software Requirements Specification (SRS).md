# Chapter 3 - Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## Purpose of this Chapter

The purpose of this chapter is to define the functional and non-functional requirements of the BookVerse application. This document serves as
the foundation for the design, development, testing, and deployment of the system. It ensures that all stakeholders have a common understanding
of the application's expected behavior and scope before implementation begins.

## Chapter Overview

This chapter defines the software requirements for the BookVerse project. It identifies the system's functional requirements, 
non-functional requirements, user roles, business rules, use cases, user stories, assumptions, constraints, and acceptance criteria. 
These requirements will guide the architecture, database design, backend development, frontend development, and testing phases of the project.

## 3.1 Introduction

The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the BookVerse application. It describes what the system should accomplish, the expected behavior of its features, and the constraints under which the system will operate.

The SRS acts as a reference document throughout the software development lifecycle and ensures that the application is developed according to clearly defined requirements.

## 3.2 Project Goals

The primary goals of the BookVerse project are:

- Develop a secure and scalable online bookstore.
- Provide an intuitive shopping experience for customers.
- Simplify bookstore management through an administration panel.
- Implement enterprise-level backend development using Spring Boot.
- Develop a responsive frontend using Angular.
- Apply software engineering best practices throughout the project.
- Build a portfolio-quality application suitable for technical interviews.
